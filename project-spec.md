# Simulated, Parallelized Digital Twin– Project Specification

## Objective
A Digital Twin for teamwork simulation. Considerations of a heirarchical skill matrix, simulated and implemented acrss asymmetric microarchitectures.

## Features
- SimGrid sandbox simulations of super-computer hypotheses
- Linux Netem network jitter-resilient
- Alder Lake CPU parity

## Scope
- Employee skills modeled based on engineering teams, computing nash equilibria.
- MPI parallelism.
- SimGrid engine with Monte Carlo re-runs.
- Stochasticity.
